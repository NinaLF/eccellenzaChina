    <p>
         In the following we will ask you to <b>judge the climate impact of different actions</b>.  <br>
         This means we ask you to give your best estimation of <b>the amount of CO <sub>2</sub> that is associated with performing certain actions.</b>  <br>
         These actions we will ask you about include people's <b> diets, commuting and travel behavior as well as their electricity supply and recycling behavior</b>.  <br>
         
     </p>
     <p>
        Most of the actions we engage in in everyday life are associated with a certain amount of carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub>) emmisions. <br>
        This includes emissions from driving, flying, using electricity, cooling or heating your home, purchasing goods and other sources. <br>
        The amount of emissions associated with different actions, however differ widely depending on the action, with some actions barely causing emissions such as cycling or having cold showers, whereas other actions cause much more emissions such as using one's car or heating one's home to a very warm temperature in winter. <br>
        The climate impact of different actions is typcially measured in CO <sub>2</sub> equivalents, so that other greenhouse gases additional to CO <sub>2</sub> (e.g., methane) are also included. <br>
        <br> 
     </p>
     <p>
         You will be asked to make judgment about some actions on a <b>scale from 0 kg CO <sub>2</sub> to 2500 kg CO <sub>2</sub> </b>. <br> <br>
        Next, you will estimate the carbon impact of <b>6</b> actions. <br> 
     </p>
